NextStep
========

For years I had an Excel spreadsheet that I used to track all of my personal projects. 
It worked well but had a few manual elements that always bothered me. I thought about converting it into a web app several times and finally got around to it. 
NextStep is intentionally a fairly simple app - I used it to learn Rails so you may notice some evidence of that.

NextStep is based on several of the techniques I learned from the book [Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280) by David Allen. 
The main two are the breaking down of projects into discrete, bite-sized steps, and prioritizing the next 
thing that needs to be worked on based on a combination of Importance and Urgency.

I used [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) for the styling, as all web apps created in 2011 were required to by law.
